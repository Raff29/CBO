# CBO is a work in progress

This application was created for a fictitious community organization. This CRUD application has two main functionalities where after logging in you can select whether you want to create/read/update a staff profile or create/read/update/delete a client profile. The server-side that was created with Node.js is connected to a MySQL database to keep track of both records. 

Most of the design was created with bootstrap with some minor CSS and JavaScript adjustments. The backend was created with Node.Js and docker was deployed for scalability and easy package management.
